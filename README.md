--> About the Game ...
Basically this game is about gussing all the states of INDIA with the help of the map.
It displays the correct guessed state in the map and counts the number of states guessed,
Finally it creates the .csv file which contains the non guesswd states name

--> Made with the use of 28 INDIAN states .csv data which contains the name of the state 
and the coordinates(which is generated using the onscreenclick function())

--> Reference of the game:
